# SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver
SlimeVR driver for OpenVR

## Installation

Downloaded the latest release, and use one of two options to install the driver (in the future Server will do it for you).

### Option one

Copy the `slimevr` folder in your SteamVR folder, usually it's located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers`. This should look like this:

### Option two

Edit file `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\openvr\openvrpaths.vrpath`, add `"Path\\to\\slimevr",` to the list of external_drivers there, like this:
